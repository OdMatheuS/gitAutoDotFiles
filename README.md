## Work in Progress...

## Starting with the credits/expiration to create this init.vim: [Diki Ananta](https://github.com/dikiaap/dotfiles), [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad) and [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen).
 

> Tip #1: Ben Awad, he has a very good and very explanatory video,
that helped me to understand better about nvim and plugins, I recommend watching it for those who are curious about the subject. 
I'll leave it fixed here: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnupOrSEikQ)

> Tip #2: ThePrimeagen, has many playlists explaining many details tips about vim that made me expand my mind, I recommend 300% for anyone interested not only in content but it is very funny, I separated a video that helped me a lot, where it creates a new file based in your init.vim settings. Which helped me to understand much better about remaps and plugins.

## Getting Started...

>I will soon update these instructions, following the new version of neovim with LSP.
>If you are already used to neovim LSP, you can use `nvim_lsp/init.vim`, I am updating more frequently
